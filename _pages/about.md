I’m a Data Scientist with a multidisciplinary background spanning engineering, compurter science, and AI. I specialize in solving complex challenges using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, leveraging a solid foundation in coding and application.

My work has included building ML applications for edge computing and designing text extraction pipelines. I’m also drawn to projects that bridge technology with real-world impact.

I thrive in interdisciplinary teams and enjoy translating ideas into practical solutions. My current interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and anomaly detection, particularly in industrial fields, diagnostics, and AI-driven decision support.

With a Master’s in Data Science and a keen interest in computer science, I am actively seeking opportunities at the intersection of deep learning and AI. I am also open to industry roles as a machine learning/deep learning engineer or data scientist.

Curious by nature, I’m driven by continuous learning and a commitment to applying technology responsibly.
